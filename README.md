# Effects of Air Pollution on Health

This project explores the impact of air pollution on public health in California through data-driven analysis. By leveraging statistical modeling and machine learning techniques, we assess correlations between pollution levels and health outcomes to derive actionable insights.

Key aspects of this project include:

* Data acquisition and preprocessing from environmental and health sources
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of pollution trends
* Regression modeling to estimate health risks based on pollution exposure
